# Trailfinders

This project was designed for Milestone Project 3 of Code Institutes' Diploma in Web Development.

Trailfinders is for all those who love being outdoors and exploring the beauty in their local area. It allows the user to search the North East of England for different hikes, add their own hikes and hopefully inspire more people to get outdoors and start exploring! The website offers users a platform to share their thoughts and opinions on the hikes posted and in doing so brings a community of people together. 

This website has been built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

## User-Experience-Design

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time User Goals

        1. As a first time user, I want to be able to easily navigate around the site without any errors and without the use of the back arrow in the browser.
        2. As a first time user, I want to be able to search for a hike route.
        3. As a first time user, I want to be able to view details about the chosen route ans see what other users thoughts/recommendations are.
        4. As a first time user, I want to be able to register on the site to get full access and see my profile
        5. As a first time user, I want to be able to quickly login to the site each time I visit.
        6. As a first time user, I want to be able to add my own hikes to my profile.
        7. As a first time user, I want to be able to edit or delete my hikes, if I want to.
        8. As a first time user, I want to be able to comment/review and rate other users' hikes.
    
    -   #### Returning User Goals

        1. As a returning user, I want to be able to easily log into the site to view my profile.
        2. As a returning user, I want to be abe to keep up-to-date on other users' hikes and comments so that i can stay involved within the community.
        3. As a returning user, I want to be able to continue to add, edit or delete my hikes.
        4. As a returning user, I want to find that any new added information follows the design and flow of the website and is easy to access.

    -   #### Site Administrator

        1. As the site administrator, I want the user to be able to register and login without any difficulty or error.

        3. As the site administrator, I want to ensure the user is able to navigate around the site without raising any errors.
        4. As the site administrator, I want to ensure that if any errors occur, they are handled gracefully and the user is shown quickly back to the website.
        5. As the site administrator, I want to ensure user information is handled securely.
        6. As the site administrator, I want to know that any future site developments can easily be adapted/added to the site.

## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme

    * Northern Trailfinders aims to help the user explore and enjoy the stunning countryside, specifically in the North East of England. 
    * The themes of the site are nature, relaxation, exploration and enjoying exercising outdoors. 
    * The colour palette was chosen for its calm and earthy tones. It was also important to make sure there was enough contrast within the palette to ensure no issues with accessibility.

-   ### Typography

    * Noto Sans was the font chosen for the site.
    * This font is clean, clear and easy to read online. 
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

    -    #### 404 Error Page
          * A 404 error page was created to ensure that if, for any reason, the webpage is unavailable, the user is taken to a message page which helps to redirect them back to the website.

         ![404 error page]()


-   ### Features For Future Implementation
    *  Asking users to input an image url when adding/editing their hike posts may feel cumbersome to the user and make it less likely that this field is filled in, affecting UX and also the aesthetic of the site. It would be beneficial to connect to any API that would already have a large range of images for the user to search and select rather than having to search for the images themselves and input. 
    * A star rating system or a thumbs up/'favourited' feature would be an interesting feature to add to the hike posts so that users could interact with others' posts and this may increase engagement and build more of a sense of community within the site.
    * It would be a good idea to have a Profile page for the user to see their own hikes and perhaps a section for their 'favourited' hikes that they have seen posted by other users so that users can keep track of where they have walked and where they would like to walk in the future. This would improve user experience and the personalisation of a profile page would mean they are more likely to return to the site.

## Technologies Used

-   ### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

    * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to import the 'Fuzzy Bubbles' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project. 
    * []() was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes
    * Gitpod was the IDE used to build the project. Git was used for version control.
    * [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
    * [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes to support in the design process.

## Credits

-   ### Content

- Code Institute was used throughout for guidance but in particular for assistance when building the CRUD functionality within the project.

- For guidance relating to the login and register functionality the following resources were utilised: [The Code City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAY7nXh83fI) and [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login/?ref=previous_article)

- For guidance when creating a responsive navbar [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36317334/bootstrap-footer-links-full-width-and-two-column-on-mobile), (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15591620/how-to-retrieve-session-data-with-flask) for information on how to retrieve session data using flask and (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6750017/how-to-query-database-by-id-using-sqlalchemy) refressher on how to query the datatbase


- [Codemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqHtmz8Ibn8&list=PLCC34OHNcOtolz2Vd9ZSeSXWc8Bq23yEz&index=34) flask series was used for assistance further understanding jinja templating. Particularly assisted with login functionality.

- [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/7982-how-to-make-a-nav-bar-show-on-scroll-up-disappear-on-scroll-down#:~:text=in%207.4%20seconds-,To%20make%20a%20nav%20bar%20menu%20show%20on%20scrolling%20upward,can%20use%20JavaScript%20and%20CSS.&text=js-,window.,you%20can%20check%20the%20window. Nabber) helped me to understand navbar scroll behaviour and also as inspiration for button design later in the project. For design improvements on the site, I wanted the navbar to disappear when the user scrolls down and reappear when scrolling up. I utilised .hide and .show within the css and added a domcontent loaded to the js file. 

- [Stack Exchange](https://cs50.stackexchange.com/questions/27648/how-to-get-a-value-using-flask-from-a-selected-option-in-a-drop-down-list) provided valuable information regarding flask and form input.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp) for refresher on form styling within html/css.

- [TableMagic] (https://stevecat.net/table-magic/) for creating the testing table
